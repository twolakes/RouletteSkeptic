In case anyone runs across this and wonders ...  
  
I suddenly had these "can't lose" roulette system videos pop up on my YouTube feed.  I scoff at the prospects of winning any player vs. casino game.  The house always stakes out an edge.  It may be small, leading the unsuspecting into times of thinking that they've found a loophole.  But, as with anything involving a random event, if you play long enough you will eventually navigate back to the mean, and to within the house edge.  
  
That said, I'm also always interested in the math and probability behind gambling.  So I took a look.  Interesting.  In most cases the crux was upping the bet after a loss and stepping back down after a win.  Naturally, I'm suspicious that they are falling for the fallicy that the results of a random event have any impact on the next iteration of that random event, i.e. the thinking that if I lost this play, it is all the more likely that I will win the next one.  Of course, random is random, whether you've just won one, or have lost 200 in a row.  A coin flip is 50/50 regardless.  
  
Anyway, I'm intrigued.  I can envision some of these systems posting more winning sessions than losing sessions.  There does seem to be some allowance for the inevitability of the house getting their winning plays.  Instead the focus is on controlling how much is lost when losing and won when winning.  
  
High volume testing is needed.  So far I've only seen these systems run in online casino situations where the user manually places their bets and wheel actually spins and waits for the ball to drop (10-15 plays in a half hour).  And of course they always win, because clickbait isn't much good if it isn't bait.  A lot of plays are needed to find what I think is the key paramter in a gambling scenario:  how much pain ($$ lost) can the player reasonably expect and be able to weather when their variance turns negative?  This is followed closely by:  is there really even a remote chance that the player can manage things over the long haul such that they come out ahead.  

As I said, I'm really interested in this stuff and always happy to hear what others think.
